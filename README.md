# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis

## Overview

In this report, I present a comprehensive analysis that aims to enhance operational efficiency by providing actionable insights into Emergency Room performance. Using Power BI, this project examines patient admissions, wait times, department referrals, and satisfaction scores to optimize resource allocation and improve patient experiences.

## Objectives

-  Monitor patient admission trends and analyze peak periods.
-  Evaluate wait times to improve patient flow and reduce delays.
-  Identify trends in department referrals for better resource allocation.
-  Assess patient satisfaction and correlate it with operational factors.
-  Provide data-driven recommendations for efficiency improvement.

## Insights

1. **Monthly View - Patient Trends:**

   Using an interactive bar chart, the dashboard tracks ER visits by month, revealing peak admission times and seasonal patterns. Evening and weekend visits show a sharp increase, highlighting the need for targeted resource allocation. Age      distribution analysis shows that elderly patients (65+) and children under 10 make up the largest proportion of ER visits. This suggests a focus on geriatric and pediatric care improvements.

3. **Consolidated View - Wait Times:**

   The wait time analysis uses a bar chart to track average patient wait times against hospital benchmarks. Data shows that average wait times exceed 30 minutes on high-traffic days, correlating with increased dissatisfaction.
A running total of daily patient volume against average wait time provides a clear visualisation of trends, showing that on days with over 100 visits, wait times increase by 20%.

5. **Patient Satisfaction - Score Analysis:**

   A satisfaction score chart highlights fluctuations in patient feedback. Lower scores correspond to longer wait times and high ER volume days. The trend analysis identifies a threshold when wait times exceed 20 minutes, satisfaction scores begin to decline significantly.

6. **Department Referrals - Specialist Allocation:**

   A department specific referral trend analysis highlights that Orthopedics and Cardiology receive the highest number of referrals. A running total chart of department referrals over time indicates a steady increase, suggesting the need for additional specialists in these high-demand departments. 40% of referred patients require follow-up visits, reinforcing the necessity for enhanced resource planning.


## Recommendations

1.   **Staffing Optimization:**
   Increase ER personnel during peak hours, particularly between 6 PM and 12 AM, to accommodate higher patient volume and reduce wait times. Implement shift adjustments to align staffing levels with data-driven peak hour trends.

3.   **Triage Efficiency:**
   Introduce a fast-track system for non-critical patients to reduce congestion in the ER. Implement digital queue management systems to provide real-time wait time updates to patients and staff.

3.   **Satisfaction Improvements:**
   Develop an automated patient feedback system to assess satisfaction in real time and identify areas for improvement. Improve patient communication during peak periods by providing estimated wait times and triage status updates.

4.   **Specialist Availability:**
   Allocate more resources and staff to Orthopedics and Cardiology, as these departments receive the highest ER referrals. Consider implementing an on-call system for high-referral departments to ensure immediate availability of specialists.

5.   **Operational Adjustments:**
   Use predictive analytics to forecast peak hours and proactively adjust hospital operations. Conduct regular training sessions for ER staff to improve workflow efficiency and emergency response times.

## Conclusion

The Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive, data-driven approach to improving ER efficiency, patient care, and hospital operations. By leveraging these insights, hospitals can proactively address challenges, reduce wait times, optimise staffing, and improve overall patient satisfaction. The dashboard's interactive visualisations help stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance hospital performance and patient outcomes.
