# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis

## Overview

In this report, I present a comprehensive analysis that aims to enhance operational efficiency by providing actionable insights into Emergency Room performance. Using Power BI, this project examines patient admissions, wait times, department referrals, and satisfaction scores to optimize resource allocation and improve patient experiences.

## Objectives

-  Monitor patient admission trends and analyze peak periods.
-  Evaluate wait times to improve patient flow and reduce delays.
-  Identify trends in department referrals for better resource allocation.
-  Assess patient satisfaction and correlate it with operational factors.
-  Provide data-driven recommendations for efficiency improvement.

## Insights

1. **Monthly View - Patient Trends:**

   Using an interactive chart, the dashboard tracks ER visits by month, revealing peak admission times and seasonal patterns. Evening and weekend visits show a sharp increase, highlighting the need for targeted resource allocation. Age      distribution analysis shows that elderly patients (65+) and children under 10 make up the largest proportion of ER visits. This suggests a focus on geriatric and pediatric care improvements.

2. **Consolidated View - Wait Times:**

   The wait time analysis uses a bar chart to track average patient wait times against hospital benchmarks. Data shows that average wait times exceed 30 minutes on high-traffic days, correlating with increased dissatisfaction.
A running total of daily patient volume against average wait time provides a clear visualisation of trends, showing that on days with over 100 visits, wait times increase by 20%.
